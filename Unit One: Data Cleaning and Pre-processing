Unit One: Data Cleaning and Pre-processing
1. Handling Missing Data: In any dataset, missing data can lead to biased or misleading analysis. Handling missing data involves strategies such as:
Removal: Eliminating rows or columns with missing values.
Imputation: Filling in missing values using techniques like mean, median, or mode substitution.
2. Data Transformation: Transforming data is crucial to ensure consistency and prepare it for analysis.
Removing Duplicates: Identifying and removing duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
Transforming Data Using a Function or Mapping: Applying functions or mappings to transform data. For example, converting temperature units from Fahrenheit to Celsius using a specific formula.
Replacing Values: Substituting certain values with others. For example, replacing null values with a predefined constant.
3. Detecting and Filtering Outliers: Outliers can significantly skew analysis and model performance. Detecting and filtering outliers involves:
Statistical Techniques: Using measures like Z-scores or the Interquartile Range (IQR) to identify outliers.
Visualization: Plotting data using box plots or scatter plots to visually detect anomalies.
4. String Manipulation: String manipulation is essential for handling textual data in pandas.
Vectorized String Functions in pandas: Utilizing pandasâ€™ string functions to perform operations like splitting, replacing, and extracting text from strings efficiently. This includes functions like str.split(), str.replace(), and str.extract().
